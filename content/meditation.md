## Links

- [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) - Great, but paid service with singular and courses for guided and unguided meditations, sleepcasts (podcasts to help you fall asleep) and more. Headspace is for people of all levels. I find Headspace to be to expensive to me, despite how much I like their service and meditations.
  - [Meditation Made Simple by Headspace - Album on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7tqhomNdL1s0GkgxOjpHMm?si=W-4HymrZTmmhvr3VSU1TvQ) - I quite like and have used many times the 5 minute and 10 minute guided meditations (links in [guided meditation section](#guided-meditation)) that are on this album
  - [Headspace - YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@headspace)
- [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/) - A platform full of guided meditations, unguided meditations, sleep sounds/music, meditation courses, meditation timers and a lot more. Insight Timer is for people of all levels. I have used this platform quite a bit a while ago and found and regularly did many guided meditations on here. This platform does have a premium plan, but the free plan gives you so much, you may not want/need the premium plan.
