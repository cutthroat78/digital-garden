## About Me

Hello, I call myself Sionnach online and this is my website that I mainly use to host my [digital garden](./digital-gardens/_index.md)

I don't really like talking/revealing much about myself, but the contents of my digital garden should give you an idea on things I like (though I do like learning in general (about anything and everything))
