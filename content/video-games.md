| [*FTL: Faster Than Light*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTL:_Faster_Than_Light) | Yes | PC (Steam) | Yes | No | No | 8/10 | Really fun real-time strategy indie game that I could play over and over. I always come back to this game and have a playthrough every once and a while. The mechanics of the game are somewhat simple and the simplicity combined with the variety of weapons, drones, character races, ship layouts, systems, (text) events, options for those events, etc. make for a great world/galaxies to explore and also makes it super fun to come up with your own strategies. The advanced edition update also adds tons of great content for **free**. I do wish there was more objectives than the get to the end of the sectors and destroy the mothership objective. An idea I had would be to add a mode that allowed to go through sectors that get harder and harder forever until you are defeated. I quite like the pixelated art style (though I am a bit of a sucker for pixelated art styles, even if they are bit overdone in the indie game world) and the chiptune music is very good and really helps me immerse myself in the game. | I played this game as a child, so I may have some childhood/nostalgia bias |
