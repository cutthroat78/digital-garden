Esperanto is a constructed international auxiliary language created by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887. It is the most successful constructed language. 

Esperanto is derived from [Romance](/language/languages/natural/romantic/_index.md) and some [Germanic](/language/languages/natural/germanic/_index.md) languages, which means it is quite easy for speakers of these languages to pickup Esperanto.
